            "Wildfire Prevention Financing Data Analyst- CrowdDoing Volunteer\n",
            "-Prevention derivatives is driven by the thesis that there is an under-valuation of passive risk (or the cost of inaction) and an under-prioritization of positive risk. Correspondingly for wildfires as an example, there is an under-recognition of the potential shared value upside of preventative action through social innovation and social interventions (such as goats & sheep that prevent wildfires). CrowdDoing.world's aim is to guarantee positive risk through leveraging existing liabilities to allow for the implications of prescriptive analytics to be financed. The under-pricing of passive risk means that liabilities are treated as either costs of doing business or un-predictable risks even for entirely preventable risks. Risk management offices have been too biased towards avoiding taking the wrong risks rather than ensuring that institutions make their own luck by seizing the abundant positive risk opportunities in social innovation. Meanwhile, the bias against positive risk leaves social innovations not to get adopted even if there would be remarkable benefits to all stakeholders if they were adopted\n",

Goal of these notes is to analyze ML model’s design, offer a potential improvement and to discuss existing approaches for data collection, and training and testing the model. It is important to notice that the model is applied to the entire selected or target region. Therefore, a geographical region R is the smallest unit we apply modeling to.\n",
